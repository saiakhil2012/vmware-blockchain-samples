# Artemis

## NFT platform on VMware Blockchain.
The goal of this project is to build an NFT platform, conforming to ERC 721 standards, on top of VMware Blockchain (Concord).Developed a client-side application that communicates with VMBC to mint and transfer NFTs. The platform allows users to create digital art NFTs on VMware blockchain by providing a title, an image URL and artist name.

# Setting Up Environment

Download metamask on google chrome and create a wallet. 

Once NFT plaform is up and running make sure to check connection of the account user. If metamask isn't automatically conncected manually connect it to your account. 

## Concord

[Concord setup link](https://confluence.eng.vmware.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=BLOC&title=Eth+Onboarding)

## Setup

This UI-app uses Clarity bootstrapping called Ganymede, which had been linked as a submodule, thus submodule update is needed:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Install application dependencies (node v14 preferred)

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
```

Close the session and reopen and `nvm` command will be available to your system.

```bash
nvm install 14  # installs node v14
nvm alias default 14 # sets default system node version to 14
```

Install depedencies for contracts and UI:

```bash
npm i  # in project root

cd clarity; # in clarity folder (main UI)
npm i
```

Deploy contracts on Concord or any network by specifying network instead of development can use Ganaches or any other network.
```bash
truffle migrate --reset --network=development
```

Deploy contracts on VMware Blockchain
```bash
truffle migrate --reset  # Since default network is Concord
```
Run NFT Platform on clarity directory
```bash
npm run start
```

Finally go to http://localhost:4200 to interact with the platform.
