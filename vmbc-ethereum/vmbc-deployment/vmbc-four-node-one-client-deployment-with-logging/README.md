# VMware Blockchain Four Node One Client Sample Deployment With Logging
The sample VMware Blockchain for Ethereum deployment includes a set of Helm charts for four Replica nodes and one Client node. The deployment on Kubernetes must only be on a supported host with a single cluster. 

Replica nodes are the participants in the consensus algorithm, concord-bft. Client nodes are the clients in the blockchain network running ethrpc.

The current sample deployment has been tested on the following components:
-	Minikube with VirtualBox, Hyperkit and Docker drivers

## Prerequisites
Make sure that you implement all the required prerequisites. See [Deployment Prerequisites](./../README.md).

              data_stream => "true"
            }
         }
     service:
       type: ClusterIP
       ports:

## VMware Blockchain four node one client deployment

The below section explains how to install VMware Blockchain four node one client deployment on minikube.

### Quick Start
#### Deploy
```sh
helm install <name of blockchain> . --set global.imageCredentials.registry=<registry address> --set global.imageCredentials.username=<username> --set global.imageCredentials.password=<password>i
```
Note that it may take upto 5 mins for the blockchain to be operational the first time it's deployed. Please wait for 5 mins or until you see ```client_id=8 is serving - the pool is ready``` in the ```vmbc-deployment-client-0-clientservice-xxx-yyy``` pod logs.

#### Test
- Get ethrpc endpoint
    ```sh
    minikube service list
    ```
  Note: If you don't see a URL using the above command then try ```minikube service client-0-ethrpc```
  
- Run ethrpc curl
    ```sh
    curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H "Accept: application/json" -d '{"id": 1, "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "eth_getBlockByNumber", "params": ["0x00", true]}' <ethrpc url from above>
    ```
  You should see a sample output similar to below
    ```json
    {"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBlockByNumber","result":{"extraData":"0x","gasLimit":"0x7fffffffffffffff","gasUsed":"0x0","hash":"0x92e4414494ec1b4752faea0d80e79f618d447743f32eff4153c5e391be1d1a88","miner":"0x52a06a6cBEF9543244C530F52b602712FE5dfb74","nonce":"0x0000000000000000","number":"0x0","parentHash":"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000","size":1,"stateRoot":"0xc5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470","timestamp":"0x1669680399","transactions":[{"blockHash":"0x92e4414494ec1b4752faea0d80e79f618d447743f32eff4153c5e391be1d1a88","blockNumber":"0x0","contractAddress":"0x","from":"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000","gas":"0x0","gasPrice":0,"hash":"0x77f5bd9e7dbe2c2772f58f53431dfdfa205991ec4ff0b2bc385adecefd8895be","input":"0x","logs":[],"nonce":"0x0","to":"0xfb389874fb4e03182a7358275eaf78008775c7ed","transactionIndex":"0x0","value":"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007fffffffffffffff"}]}}
    ```
See [Troubleshooting](./../Troubleshooting.md) for any errors.

#### View logs in Kibana
- Open a port-forward to Kibana
    ```sh
    kubectl port-forward svc/kibana-kibana 5601:5601
    ```
- Open the following page to see logs
http://localhost:5601/app/discover#
- On first open, it will ask to create an index.
 - Click on "Create index pattern"
 - Type logs-generic-default* in the Name field and select the @timestamp field from the Timestamp field drop down.
   If you don't see logs-generic-default, wait a few minutes for the index to be created after a blockchain has been deployed.
   If you haven't deployed a blockchain yet, then you will have to return to this page after the blockchain is deployed.
   The index is automatically created when the first blockchain is deployed.
 - After you click Create index pattern on the page above, you should see a page to customize the index fields.
   You can leave this page as is as the defaults are fine.
 - Now you can search and view logs on this page: http://localhost:5601/app/discover#. You can filter logs based on blockhain ID, service name etc.

#### Uninstall
##### Uninstall Blockchain
```sh
helm uninstall <name of blockchain>
```
##### Uninstall ELK
```sh
helm delete elasticsearch 
helm delete logstash
helm delete kibana
```
